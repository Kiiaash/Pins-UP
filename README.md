# Pins-UP

I created a small job board website to dive deeper into the dynamics of Laravel. My main goal was to understand how the framework handles various tasks, such as routing, data management, and user interaction, rather than just using it blindly. Through this project, I gained valuable insight into the structure of a framework and how it’s developed to simplify complex workflows. It's really important to me to know what's happening inside the framework—how Laravel's components work together to manage requests, controllers, models, and views—so I can use it more effectively in future projects.
